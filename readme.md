# **RPG Project**

This is a collaborative, open-ended project to build an RPG by randomly adding features as we feel inspired. There’s no specific goal for the project — the idea is to create a clean, flexible system where everyone can freely contribute new ideas without any target or goal in mind.

Feel free to fork, clone, and contribute in any way you see fit.

## **Project Overview**

The RPG project is an experimental and open-ended RPG game designed to be extended with random features. Focus is on:
- Keeping the code clean and modular
- Ensuring contributors can easily add their own features
- Encouraging creativity with no predefined goals


## **How to Contribute**

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your forked version**
3. Add your own **features, roles, items, or systems** in the appropriate folder, or create new folders if needed
4. **Commit your changes** with meaningful commit messages
5. **Create a pull request** to merge your changes into the main project

## **Guidelines**

- **Modularity**: Ensure that the code you add is modular and does not interfere with existing features. For example, if you add a new class or system, make sure it can work alongside the rest of the code without breaking it.
- **Clean Code**: Try to keep the code neat and easy to read. Follow standard JavaScript conventions, and ensure variable and method names are descriptive.
- **Randomness Encouraged**: Feel free to add **any features** you want! There's no need to follow a roadmap — this project thrives on random additions.
- **Communication**: If you're introducing significant changes, consider explaining them in the pull request to make it easier for others to understand.
